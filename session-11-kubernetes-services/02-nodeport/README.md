# NodePort Service — External Host-Level Cluster Access

## 1. What is a NodePort Service?
A `NodePort` service is the simplest native way to route external client traffic directly into your Kubernetes cluster.

When you configure `type: NodePort`, Kubernetes:
1. Allocates a dedicated high port from the range **`30000–32767`** (default pool).
2. Opens this exact port on **every single worker node** across the entire cluster.
3. Automatically creates a `ClusterIP` under the hood to route internal packets.

Any traffic sent to `http://<Any-Worker-Node-IP>:<NodePort>` is intercepted by `kube-proxy` on that node and forwarded to one of the backend pods, even if the destination pod is running on a different node.

## 2. Why Do We Need NodePort? (The Problem It Solves)

### The Problem: ClusterIP is Inaccessible from the Outside
`ClusterIP` uses internal private IPs (e.g., `10.96.0.0/12`) that are non-routable over the internet or office LAN. A user sitting at home or a client browser cannot reach a `ClusterIP`.

### The Solution: Expose a Dedicated Host Port
`NodePort` opens a port directly on the host machine's network interface. Anyone with network access to the node's IP address can access the workload on that static port.

## 3. Think of It Like This: The Hotel Reception & Room Extension
* **The Hotel Building** = A physical or virtual Worker Node.
* **The Hotel Main Gate Guard (`nodePort: 30080`)** = The outside security gate that lets visitors enter from the street.
* **The Hotel Lobby Desk (`port: 80`)** = The internal reception desk coordinating guests.
* **The Guest's Room Door (`targetPort: 80`)** = The actual room where the guest is staying.

Even if you enter through North Wing Gate (`Node 1`) or South Wing Gate (`Node 2`), both gates direct you to the same guest rooms.

---

## 4. Where is NodePort Used in Production?
* **On-Premise and Bare-Metal Clusters:** When you do not have cloud APIs (AWS/GCP/Azure) to automatically provision a cloud load balancer.
* **Development and Staging Environments:** Quickly exposing applications on local clusters (Minikube, Kind, k3s, MicroK8s).
* **Exposing Ingress Controllers:** Ingress Controllers (like Traefik, HAProxy, or NGINX) are often exposed to physical hardware routers via a static `NodePort` (`30080` / `30443`).
* **Non-HTTP Protocols and Legacy Systems:** Exposing raw TCP/UDP services directly on known host ports.

### File: `app-deployment.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app-nodeport
  labels:
    app: web-nodeport
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-nodeport
  template:

        app: web-nodeport
    spec:

        - name: web-server
          image: nginx:1.25-alpine
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "50m"
              memory: "64Mi"
            limits:
              cpu: "100m"
              memory: "128Mi"
```

### File: `service.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-service-nodeport
  labels:
    app: web-nodeport
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: web-nodeport
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30080
      protocol: TCP
```

### Key Field Explanations:
* `spec.type: NodePort`: Declares the service as accessible on worker node IPs.
* `spec.ports[0].nodePort: 30080`: Manually sets the external port. If omitted, Kubernetes randomly assigns an available port from `30000–32767`.
* `spec.ports[0].port: 80`: The internal cluster port used by internal microservices.
* `spec.ports[0].targetPort: 80`: The container port where Nginx listens.

## 6. How to Run and Deploy

### Step 1: Apply the Deployment
```bash
kubectl apply -f 02-nodeport/app-deployment.yaml
```

Check pod status:
```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=web-nodeport -o wide
```

Expected Output:
```text
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP            NODE
web-app-nodeport-77df98f8d9-6m2qp   1/1     Running   0          14s   10.244.0.20   minikube
web-app-nodeport-77df98f8d9-v9z8k   1/1     Running   0          14s   10.244.0.21   minikube
```

### Step 2: Apply the NodePort Service
```bash
kubectl apply -f 02-nodeport/service.yaml
```

Verify the service and the port mapping:
```bash
kubectl get svc web-service-nodeport
```

Expected Output:
```text
NAME                   TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
web-service-nodeport   NodePort   10.96.210.44    <none>        80:30080/TCP   10s
```
Notice the syntax `80:30080/TCP`:
* `80` = Internal Cluster Port
* `30080` = External NodePort

## 7. How to Check Website Traffic on NodePort

### Method A: Direct Access via Node IP (Standard Kubernetes / Docker Desktop)
Find your worker node IP:
```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

Send a request using curl or open in your browser:
```bash
curl http://localhost:30080
```
Or with Minikube:
```bash
curl http://$(minikube ip):30080
```

### Method B: Minikube Service Tunnel (macOS / Docker driver)
On macOS with Docker driver, the VM IP is inside a private network bridge. Minikube provides a helper command to open a live browser session:
```bash
minikube service web-service-nodeport
```
Or to retrieve the direct reachable URL:
```bash
minikube service web-service-nodeport --url
```

### Expected Output in Browser / Terminal:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
...
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
<p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and working.</p>
...
</html>
```

## 8. Important Limitations of NodePort

1. **Port Range Constraints:** Limited to ports `30000–32767` by default. You cannot expose standard port `80` or `443` directly without custom API server flags.
2. **One Service Per Port:** Port numbers cannot be shared. If Service A uses `30080`, Service B cannot use `30080`.
3. **No Automatic DNS / High Availability:** If a worker node goes down, clients connecting to that specific node IP experience downtime unless an external load balancer balances traffic across all node IPs.
4. **Security Exposure:** Opens ports across all nodes in the cluster, requiring strict firewall / Security Group management.

## 9. Cleanup
```bash
kubectl delete -f 02-nodeport/service.yaml
kubectl delete -f 02-nodeport/app-deployment.yaml
```
